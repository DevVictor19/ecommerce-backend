## Running the project locally

### Requirements

- docker and docker compose

### 1. Setup .env file

Create a file called .env on project's root folder, and put something like this inside:

```
# Database
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_NAME=ecommerce
DB_USER=admin
DB_PASSWORD=admin
DB_PORT=27017

# Server
SERVER_URL=http://localhost:8080
SERVER_SECRET=your secret key

# Gateways
PAYMENT_GW_URL=https://sandbox.asaas.com/api/v3
PAYMENT_GW_KEY=your asaas key
```

### 2. Starting the services

Tu run in production mode just go to the project's root folder and run:

#### Production mode

```
docker compose up -d
```

#### Development mode (you can access the database on host machine)

```
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d
```

#### This will start the api on http://localhost:8080 and the database at the specified port on .env.

#### The database is empty, and you have to create a user with ADMIN role in the database for creating new products.
